# <My Prework Study Guide>

## Description

This is a simple website intended to demonstrate the basic skills I learned during prework for the Spring 2023 Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp. After graduating from Tech with a Computer Science degree in 2003, I immediately switched to a career in law. Due to changes in my family I've decided to switch back so that I can work closer to home.

This prework study guide project is intended to practice skills as well as remind myself of basic tools and syntax needed to kick start my bootcamp experience. 

The prework project has put me back in the mindset of a developer - that is someone who is always learning, not just doing. It helped remind me of knowledge I haven't used in years as well as introduce me to tools such as github and devops.


## Installation

This project is hosted in github, synced through my CLI, programmed in the IDE Visual Studio Code and executable on any browser.

## Usage

This studyguide is intended for notes of the prework for the GT coding bootcamp that covers HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. One key is the JavaScript functionality was developed for use with the Chrome developer's console. The console will display the prework topics as well as a randomized topic suggestion.
